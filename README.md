# Welcome to Your Timedoor Expo + React Native App üëã

![README-banner](/assets/images/readme-banner.jpg)

This Timedoor test run is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). Its primary purpose is to showcase and facilitate the Teens App Development course (3 parts).

## Get Started

1. Open your terminal on your machine.

2. Copy the `https` or `ssh` link to clone the project.

3. Paste the link into your terminal and run the following command to clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeNKoffee/timedoor-react-native-test-app.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd timedoor-react-native-test-app
   ```

5. Open the project.

6. Install the dependencies using VS Code‚Äôs built-in terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

7. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you‚Äôll find options to open the app in a:

- Development build
- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Expo Go, a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can begin developing by editing the files inside the app directory. This project uses file-based routing.

## Get a Fresh Project

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the app-example directory and create a blank app directory where you can start developing.
